# Overview of the School District Analysis

The school board requested to update the school district analysis on its 15 high schools to include modified teasting scores for Thomas High School (THS) ninth grade students. This is due to suspected score fraud in the original school district analysis for Thomas High School's ninth grade reading and math scores. The analysis removed the scores for ninth grade THS students and recast the average math, average reading, percentage passing for reading and math as well as overall passing percentages. The findings are as follows.

# Results

The following areas were impacted by the updated school distric analysis:
- Math & Reading Scores by Grade -
  Thomas high school's ninth grade scores for math and reading were pulling down the percentage passing for math and reading each, as well as the overall percentage passing for math/reading.

  - See reading scores by grade here, https://github.com/Ninax3/School_District_Analysis/blob/main/Resources/Reading%20Scores%20by%20Grade.png

- District Summary -
The original analysis showed overall passing reading, passing math and passing reading & math percentages below 70%. These findings were an anomaly for the district scores compared to the other high shcools. With the update, these scores for Thomas High School increased to the relative norm for the district in the 90% range.
